                Computer Science is all about how computers work and the technology behind them. A key area is **algorithms**, which are like step-by-step
procedures for solving problems efficiently. They form the foundation of computer operations. **Binary numbers** are fundamental because they
represent data using just two states, essential for computing. Data structures, such as arrays or linked lists, help organize information
effectively. Programming languages enable writing software, crucial for any technology. Cybersecurity is vital too, protecting systems from
threats. So, Computer Science covers algorithms, binary numbers, data structures, programming, and cybersecurityâ€”all important building blocks.
